Hello Everyone, and welcome to the TubeGuardian dev team!

I'm going to try and make this short and sweet with a few basic recommendations. 

1. I will be setting up a mailing list to facilitate communication, please send me a message letting me know you want in on the mailing list, and what email address to use for it
2. Please feel free to fork the repository into different language ports
3. Please feel free to create wiki pages to help with the management of forks you create
4. Have fun!

The main bulk of code that matters is in clsStatMonger.cs ... read and be merry!
